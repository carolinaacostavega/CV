  <title>Carolina's personal site</title>

    <p>I am a scientist/biologist/Research Technicial with a
    high level of expertise and knowledge in life science.
    My background with both human and plant molecular biology
    has given me a broad perspective with which to tackle research
    problems and also it has taught me how to defend my viewpoint to
    a team with data to back it up, but never so inflexibly that
    I couldn’t be persuaded by a better argument from a colleague.
    I am passionate about working in a team of great people
    to explore the frontiers of life science.

      <li>Currently, I am working on projects focused on undestanding what
        factors promote <em><a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/126595">exhaustive CD8 T Cells</em></a>, a phenotype associated with
        better outcome in T1D. We identified
        islet-specific CD8+ T cells using high-content, singlet-cell mass cytometry
        in combination with peptide-loaded MHC tetramer staining. We applied an
        analytical method, DISCOV-R, to characterize these rare subsets. </li>
      <li> Currently working on understanding <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.18.303420">COVID-19</em></a> immune landscape and its
        correlation with disease severity.

      <li>Study of IL-1RL1 polymorphism (risk and no risk) associated with asthma risk, using M13 and
        MO2 vectors in HEK-Blue IL-18 cells.
      </li>
      <li>Association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with susceptibility to type 1
        diabetes using MGB-eclipse (fam-Tet), pleiades (Fam-Vic) and taqman.
